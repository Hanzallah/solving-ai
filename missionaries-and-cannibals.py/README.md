# AI-461 Homework 01

`solution.py` contains the solution we have come up with for the Missionaries and Cannibals problem. We have designed the code to work with an arbitrary number of cannibals, missionaries and boat size that the program takes as argument input and solves using DFS.

To test our code for part 1 (5 cannibals, 5 missionaries, 3 max), run:
```bash
python solution.py 5 5 3
```

To test our code for part 2b (6 cannibals, 6 missionaries, 5 max), run:
```bash
python solution.py 6 6 5
```
